commit note:

Fixed some git issues:
- Tried to rebased every commit to ammend name + email, very messy
- I was also running git add . NOT from the root directlory,
it seems git add -A is needed in that case, as it includes all files even from parent directories 
https://github.com/git-guides/git-add
- perhaps better to stage and commit on a per file basis from now on....

# camera_fps = webcam_obj.get(cv2.CAP_PROP_FPS) # was going to sync frames manually..... see note
becasue i though .read would read dublicates if there was a delay, but actually .read() is mostly fully blocking and will wait for the camera mostly always

# first:
# time_per_frame = 1 / camera_fps               # exact time needed for the camera to supply 1 frame
# print("[SP:] time_per_frame: ", time_per_frame)

# then:
# elapsed_time = time.time() - start_time         # gather the time it took to read a frame into this process (+ other operations)
# print("[SP:] elapsed_time: ", elapsed_time)
# diff = max(0, time_per_frame - elapsed_time)    # subtract it from the API stated time_per_frame (or retun 0)
# print("[SP:] difference: ", diff)
# time.sleep(diff)
