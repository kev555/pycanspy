cv2.waitKey() and the & 0xFF operation:

cv2.waitKey() returns an integer representing the key code of a pressed key. 
This integer might be larger than 8 bits and contain extra information about modifier keys or system-specific flags. 
The & 0xFF operation is used to mask out all but the lowest 8 bits of this integer, which typically represent the standard ASCII code of the key. 
This ensures that the code correctly identifies the pressed key, regardless of any extra information or system-specific variations in the higher bits.


brief example to illustrate how cv2.waitKey() might return a value with extra information in the higher bits, and how & 0xFF extracts the relevant part:

Let's say:
You press the 'q' key while holding down the Ctrl key.
On your specific system, cv2.waitKey() returns the following 32-bit integer (this is just an example; the actual value varies):

00000010 00000000 00000000 01110001  (binary representation)
The lower 8 bits (01110001) represent the ASCII code for 'q' (113 in decimal).
The higher bits (the rest) represent the Ctrl key being pressed (this is system-specific).
Using & 0xFF

If you perform a bitwise AND with 0xFF (which is binary 00000000 0000000 00000000 11111111), you get:

    00000010 00000000 00000000 01110001  (original value)
&   00000000 0000000 00000000 11111111  (0xFF)
=   00000000 0000000 00000000 01110001  (result)
As you can see, the higher bits are all set to 0, and the lower 8 bits (01110001) remain unchanged. This is the ASCII code for 'q'.


In Python:

import cv2
# Simulate cv2.waitKey() returning a value with modifier keys
key_code_with_ctrl = 513  # Example value, represents 'q' + Ctrl

# Extract the lower 8 bits
ascii_code = key_code_with_ctrl & 0xFF

print(f"Key code with Ctrl: {key_code_with_ctrl}")
print(f"ASCII code: {ascii_code}")

if ascii_code == ord('q'):
    print("The 'q' key was pressed (regardless of Ctrl)")
In this example, key_code_with_ctrl is a hypothetical value returned by cv2.waitKey() when 'q' and Ctrl are pressed. 
The & 0xFF operation extracts the ASCII code for 'q', allowing the code to correctly identify the 'q' key press, even if other modifier keys were also pressed.
