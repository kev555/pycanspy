1. PC App (Python)
Captures or loads video frames.

Uses aiortc (or similar) to stream WebRTC video.

Connects to signaling server on the VPS to:

Send SDP offer

Receive SDP answer

Exchange ICE candidates

2. VPS (Server)
Serves the HTML/JS via HTTP/HTTPS (e.g., with Nginx, Flask, etc.).

Runs the signaling server (e.g., WebSocket using websockets, aiohttp, or Node.js).

Relays signaling messages between:

Python app on the PC

Browser client

3. Browser
Loads HTML/JS from VPS.

Connects to signaling server on the VPS.

Receives SDP offer, responds with answer, exchanges ICE.

Establishes direct WebRTC connection to the PC.

Plays the incoming video stream.

üîÅ Flow Overview
Browser opens HTML ‚Üí connects to VPS signaling.

Python app connects to same signaling server.

Python sends offer ‚Üí signaling relays to browser.

Browser responds with answer ‚Üí signaling relays back.

Both exchange ICE candidates.

WebRTC connection is made directly between PC ‚Üî browser.

Stream starts ‚Äî VPS is out of the media path.


VPS = Control + coordination

PC = Media source

Browser = Viewer

Media flows peer-to-peer, minimizing latency and load on VPS
